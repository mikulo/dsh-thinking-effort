# dsh-thinking-effort

A [DSH (DeepSeek Harness)](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) plugin that adds configurable reasoning effort levels to hand-declared `llm-pi-ai` models and sets a default reasoning effort for subagents.

> **About this fork:** this repository is an independent fork of [hytime/dsh-thinking-effort](https://github.com/hytime/dsh-thinking-effort). The package is renamed to `@mikulo/dsh-thinking-effort`, is not published to npm, and is installed, updated, and removed straight from GitHub (commands below). The built `lib/index.js` and `lib/client.js` are committed, so a git install needs no local build; after changing sources run `npm run build` and commit `lib/` together with them.
>
> Switching from the upstream `@hytime/dsh-thinking-effort`: run `dsh plugin --profile <profile> remove @hytime/dsh-thinking-effort`, then `add github:mikulo/dsh-thinking-effort`; if the profile's `cordis.patch.yml` still has an `id: thinking-effort` entry, change its `name` to `'@mikulo/dsh-thinking-effort'` to keep your settings.

> **Compatibility boundaries:** DSH Runtime compatibility covers the Settings transport only: modern DSH exposes `remote.settings`, while legacy DSH exposes `connection.api.settings`. The plugin detects the available runtime capability and keeps the legacy fallback optional, so the settings page does not require a Remote provider on older DSH builds.
>
> Gateway Protocol compatibility is a separate layer. When the DSH schema exposes them, the plugin supports 15 common scalar `llm-pi-ai.compat` fields, grouped into role/reasoning, format/output, streaming/tools, and storage/cache. Boolean fields offer `Auto`, supported, and unsupported; enum fields offer `Auto` and their concrete values. DSH `0.1.0-rc.7` does not provide gateway compat settings. DSH `0.1.0-rc.8` through `<0.1.2-alpha.1` provide the other fields, but not `supportsFinishReason` or `supportsThinkingTokenBudget`; DSH `0.1.2-alpha.1` and later expose all 15 when supported by the schema. The optional `dsh-llm-openai-completions` transport can take over eligible custom OpenAI-compatible thinking providers when it is installed and enabled. `Auto` unsets the current-layer override and restores the next value in the inheritance chain.
>
> DSH `0.1.2-alpha.1` and later accept language-pack locale IDs through `LocaleRuntime`. This plugin registers `ja` and `ko` dynamically, so no DSH core fork is required. Older DSH builds that only expose built-in locale IDs support `zh` and `en` only.
>
> The published runtime entries are `lib/index.js` (Host) and `lib/client.js` (Client). After changing TypeScript or locale sources, run `npm run build` before running DSH or packing the plugin. Current DSH does not expose a public semver metadata contract, so runtime capability detection is authoritative. An optional version is used only when explicit metadata or test input supplies it; unknown valid versions still use the detected capabilities. The plugin supports both modern `remote.settings` and legacy `connection.api.settings`.
>
> The Host registers its `dsh-thinking-effort` Settings namespace through the host-provided Settings `installSection` when available, and falls back to the legacy `register` path otherwise. Under the `0.1.7`+ entry-config model neither path exists, and the section comes from the exported `Config` instead. It does not depend on `@deepseek-ai/dsh-settings` at runtime, so the package installs cleanly into DSH profiles configured with `autoInstallPeers: false` without introducing a second Cordis runtime.

## DSH compatibility

| DSH range | Gateway compatibility settings |
| --- | --- |
| `0.1.0-rc.7` | Not available |
| `0.1.0-rc.8` to `<0.1.2-alpha.1` | Available when exposed by the DSH schema, but without `supportsFinishReason` and `supportsThinkingTokenBudget` |
| `0.1.2-alpha.1` to `<0.1.7-0` | All 15 fields when exposed by the DSH schema. Releases at or beyond the newest bound are unmapped: the plugin keeps working and follows the capabilities the running host reports instead |

From DSH `0.1.0-rc.8` onward, field availability follows the runtime schema. The table shows the maximum field set for each DSH version; the route protocol can further reduce it.

A gateway compat field can be configured only when the DSH version, runtime schema, and route's `api` protocol all support it. Unsupported fields stay hidden and are not written to Settings. Among these 15 fields, `openai-completions` supports all 15, while `openai-responses`, `azure-openai-responses`, and `openai-codex-responses` support only `supportsDeveloperRole`, `supportsStrictMode`, and `supportsLongCacheRetention`. If `api` is missing or unrecognized, the runtime schema and DSH validation remain the final authority.

DSH `0.1.7` and later derive each settings form from the Loader entry's own `Config` schema (the entry-config model); a plugin that exports none gets no form at all. This plugin exports that schema, so on `0.1.7`+ its section is the Loader entry id `thinking-effort`, while `0.1.0-rc.7` through `0.1.6` keep the registered namespace `dsh-thinking-effort`; the Client resolves whichever id the running Host publishes. `subagentEffort` now lives in this plugin's own section, and on `0.1.7`+ the old `llm-pi-ai` location is no longer a fallback: that section's schema declares only `providers`, so the Host refuses a write to any other path and drops undeclared keys from the user layer it reports. An existing subagent default therefore reads as unset there and has to be chosen again in the plugin's settings card. A snapshot this plugin exported before `0.1.7` still carries the value inside `llm-pi-ai`; importing it migrates the value into the plugin's own section, which is also what lets its providers import, because the Host refuses the whole batch when any op path is not volatile. On `0.1.7`+ settings are stored in the active profile's `cordis.patch.yml` instead of `~/.dsh/settings.yaml`, which `0.1.7` no longer uses.

## Why use it?

The `llm-pi-ai` adapter supports hand-declared third-party models, but those entries often do not declare `reasoningEfforts`. As a result, Composer does not show a reasoning effort selector, and gateway-specific values such as `ultra` cannot be mapped to DSH's standard levels.

This plugin provides the configuration layer needed to:

- Add default `off`, `high`, and `max` options to models your own profile declares without a declaration; a model that only a composition base or a schema default supplies is left unfilled and counted in the Host log;
- Configure reasoning levels per model from the DSH settings page;
- Map a DSH level such as `high` to a gateway value such as `ultra`;
- Set a default reasoning effort for subagents while preserving explicit request values;
- Keep existing user-defined model declarations unchanged.

The plugin is usually unnecessary when you only use built-in DSH models and their reasoning controls already work.

## Identifiers

These identifiers have different responsibilities:

| Identifier | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `@mikulo/dsh-thinking-effort` | npm package, browser bundle path, loader ID, and host/client runtime ID |
| `thinking-effort` | Cordis composition entry ID and settings Slot ID |

## Features

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Default levels | Adds `off`, `high`, and `max` without overwriting custom values, for the models your user layer declares; a model only a composition base or a schema default supplies is left unfilled and counted in the Host log |
| Per-model editor | Select levels and configure gateway values for both catalog/modelOverrides and `models[]` entries in Settings |
| Gateway compatibility | Configure 15 common scalar fields globally per provider or separately per model, grouped by role/reasoning, format/output, streaming/tools, and storage/cache; groups are collapsed by default |
| OpenCode session Header | Enable a dynamic `x-opencode-session` per exact model. By default a deterministic `ses_…` generator bound to the DSH session (with template / expression / script modes to survive upstream format changes), without storing a fixed Header value |
| OpenCode user-agent override | Rewrite the `user-agent` header per provider/model (custom routes included) to mimic an upstream client, with optional per-route values; off by default |
| Gateway mapping | Send `ultra` when the user selects DSH `high` |
| Backup and profiles | Export the current configuration as a JSON file for migration; save named profiles locally and switch between them; choose merge or replace before importing, with an impact preview |
| Composer effort slider | Registers an optional Composer `seat` when the Web runtime exposes `modelDirectories`, with host-resolved tiers for the current `provider/model` |
| Subagent default | Apply a default effort only when a subagent request has no explicit value |
| Multilingual settings | Includes Chinese, English, Japanese, and Korean dictionaries; Japanese/Korean switching uses DSH language-pack support |
| Version watermark | Show the installed plugin version in the bottom-right corner |

## Install, upgrade, and remove

Use the official DSH CLI to manage the plugin profile. A plain `npm install` does not register a DSH profile bundle.

```bash
# Install the latest version
dsh plugin --profile <profile> add github:mikulo/dsh-thinking-effort

# Install a specific version
dsh plugin --profile <profile> add github:mikulo/dsh-thinking-effort#v0.4.1

# Upgrade
dsh plugin --profile <profile> update @mikulo/dsh-thinking-effort

# Remove
dsh plugin --profile <profile> remove @mikulo/dsh-thinking-effort
rm -f "${DSH_HOME:-$HOME/.dsh}/thinking-effort-loaded.json"
```

See [INSTALL.md](./docs/INSTALL.md) for profile discovery, migration, validation, and troubleshooting.

## Quick use

1. Open DSH **Settings → Model capabilities and effort**.
2. Use the **Page language** selector at the top to choose `中文`, `English`, `日本語`, or `한국어`. DSH uses the persisted locale first, then the browser language, then English as the fallback.
3. Choose a subagent default from the **Subagent default effort** card, then click **Apply**.
4. Use **Quick settings** to apply the official DeepSeek or generic preset to all models, or expand a provider and model for detailed configuration.
5. Use the search field to filter models by name or ID. Model rows show text/image input capability badges, a context-window badge when declared, and a settings button for per-model editing.
6. Select a reasoning level and enter the exact gateway value. For example:

   | DSH level | Gateway value |
   | --- | --- |
   | `off` | Leave empty to omit the parameter |
   | `high` | `ultra` |
   | `max` | `max` |

7. In the model editor, optionally enable **OpenCode session Header** for the exact model that needs `x-opencode-session`. It is off by default, sends a deterministic `ses_…` value generated from the current DSH session, does not inherit across models or providers, and saves immediately when toggled — there is no separate save button. See the [generator section](#opencode-session-header-generator) when the upstream changes its expected format.
8. Return to Composer, choose the configured model, then use its reasoning-effort slider.

### Composer reasoning-effort slider

When the DSH Web runtime exposes `modelDirectories`, the client registers an optional `conversation.input.model` `seat` with a low `shadow` priority; it does not modify Composer itself. The slider reads the host-resolved `reasoning.efforts` array for the current exact `provider/model`, so it shows only the tiers currently effective for that model. Changing a level submits the ordinary session model selection; it does not mutate the plugin Settings document.

The model's `defaultEffort` is shown through the matching tier. If the host model has no `defaultEffort`, the panel also provides **Follow model default**, which submits a selection without a reasoning-effort override. The control uses the host `--dsw-*` semantic tokens and therefore follows the active light or dark theme without its own theme preference.

The `seat` is not registered when the runtime does not provide `modelDirectories`; the Settings page and its legacy Settings transport behavior continue to work. This plugin does not modify the DSH Composer, `ui-conversation`, or `ui-model-selection` packages.

The settings page shows the installed version as a small watermark such as `v0.1.14` in the bottom-right corner.

### Gateway compatibility configuration

The provider `compat` block is the global default for every model under that provider. The Settings page groups the 15 fields into four sections that are collapsed by default. Configure provider defaults with the official DSH YAML shape:

```yaml
providers:
  qwen-gateway:
    compat:
      supportsDeveloperRole: false
      maxTokensField: max_tokens
    models:
      - id: qwen-plus
      - id: qwen-thinking
        compat:
          maxTokensField: max_completion_tokens
```

Field-by-field, each value resolves independently in this order: model → provider → base/catalog → protocol. URL/hostname detection is not used as a compat source. A model value overrides only that field. `Auto` removes the current-layer value, restores provider inheritance when applicable, and lets the next value in the chain take effect. Provider defaults apply to every model on the route; a model edit changes only the current model. For a route/provider, non-empty `models[]` and non-empty `modelOverrides` are mutually exclusive; the official schema rejects this invalid configuration, and the plugin fails closed for malformed data.

The provider area in Settings edits defaults for all models. Both catalog models and custom YAML `models[]` entries expose a single-model compat editor: catalog models write only the target fields with field-level `set`/`unset` operations under `modelOverrides.<model>.compat`, while `models[]` models write one complete `providers.<route>.models` array set while preserving other entries and fields. A model edit does not change other models.

These compat values are control plane configuration. They do not implement or replace the gateway transport; an external transport remains responsible for network requests.

### OpenCode session Header generator

The model editor has a separate **OpenCode session Header** switch, stored in the plugin's own settings section, not in `llm-pi-ai.compat`. Enable it only for the exact `provider/model` that requires `x-opencode-session`; another model on the same route, including a GPT model, does not inherit it. Flipping the switch saves immediately — there is no separate save button — and reopening the model shows the persisted value.

When enabled and no `format` is configured, the Host sends a deterministic value in the canonical `ses_` shape derived from the current DSH session: `ses_` + 12 hex characters (a 48-bit millisecond timestamp minted once per session) + 14 Base62 characters (an 80-bit digest of the normalized DSH session id). The same DSH session always sends the same value: the value is stickied per session, and eviction from the bounded value cache drops only the cached value — never the first-use mint — so an evicted session keeps its value when revisited. Only a DSH restart re-mints the hex timestamp, and only in `firstUse` mode (`time: hash` needs no state at all). The 14-character suffix is stable across DSH restarts because it is derived, not stored. Different sessions — including each subagent run — derive distinct values.

The generator is configurable either from the **Session value generator** card on the settings page or by hand in the settings document: on `0.1.7`+ it is the `opencodeSession.format` section of the active profile's `cordis.patch.yml` (addressed by the Loader entry id `thinking-effort`); on `0.1.0-rc.7` through `0.1.6` it is `dsh-thinking-effort.opencodeSession.format`, for example in `~/.dsh/settings.yaml`. The two are equivalent. Four modes cover upstream format changes without rebuilding the plugin:

- `ses-derive` (default) — the canonical generator above. `time: firstUse` mints the hex block once per session; `time: hash` derives it from the session digest so the whole value is identical on every machine.
- `passthrough` — the previous behavior: send the raw DSH session id.
- `template` — a string with `{hex12}`, `{tail62}`, `{sessionId}`, `{rawSessionId}`, `{sha256}`, `{now}`, `{provider}`, `{model}` placeholders.
- `expression` — a safe additive expression with the same context plus `sha256`, `slice`, `lower`, `upper` helpers, e.g. `'ses_' + hex12 + tail62`.
- `script` — an absolute path to a JS file exporting `format(context)`, hot-reloaded on file change; on load or evaluation errors it falls back to `ses-derive`.

An optional `validate` regex plus `onInvalid: warn | drop | send` checks the produced value against the latest upstream expectation (`warn` is the default). An `x-opencode-session` already supplied by the adapter or caller is always preserved and never overwritten. The setting does not choose or change `openai-completions`, `openai-responses`, or `anthropic-messages`. See [INSTALL.md](./docs/INSTALL.md) for the full configuration reference.

Sub2API, CPA, and other forwarding gateways must preserve and forward `x-opencode-session` to the OpenCode upstream. A static route setting such as `llm-pi-ai.providers.<route>.headers.x-opencode-session` is not an equivalent replacement: it uses one value for every conversation and cannot provide per-conversation routing or prompt-cache affinity. Restart DSH after Host changes and refresh the Web page after Settings or Client changes.

### OpenCode user-agent override

Some upstreams also fingerprint the `user-agent` header. The `llm-pi-ai` adapter forces its attribution `user-agent` (`deepseek-harness/…`) on every provider request and strips any provider-configured value, so the header cannot be changed through DSH itself. This plugin rewrites it at the last layer before the request leaves — scoped per provider/model and off by default. The YAML below shows the namespace shape the releases before `0.1.7` read:

```yaml
dsh-thinking-effort:
  opencodeSession:
    userAgent:
      value: "opencode/1.18.31 ai-sdk/provider-utils/4.0.23 runtime/bun/1.3.14"
      providers:
        opencode-go:
          enabled: true              # whole route
        sundrawnewapi-private:
          value: "opencode/1.18.31"  # optional per-route value
          models:
            mimo-v2.5-free: true     # exact model
```

- `value` is the master switch: empty or absent disables the override everywhere.
- A route matches when its `enabled` flag is true (all models) or the exact model is toggled on; custom routes work by their provider name.
- A route's own `value` wins over the master `value`.
- Unmatched requests keep DSH's attribution `user-agent` untouched.

It composes with the session Header above (same request layer), so enabling both fully mimics an upstream client. See [INSTALL.md](./docs/INSTALL.md) for the reference; restart DSH after Host changes.

### Backup and profiles

The **Backup and profiles** card, below the language selector and the Subagent default effort card, exports the current configuration, keeps named profiles on this machine, and imports a file exported earlier.

1. **Export current config** downloads `dsh-config-<timestamp>.json`. The file holds the `llm-pi-ai` user layer and this plugin's own settings section as written: those sections are keyed `dsh-thinking-effort` on `0.1.0-rc.7` through `0.1.6` and by the Loader entry id `thinking-effort` on `0.1.7`+. No credential value is exported — a provider keeps only the name of the environment variable holding its key (`apiKeyEnv`) — but every value stored in those layers is copied verbatim, and a plaintext token kept in provider `headers` is one of them. Keep it safe.
2. Under **Profile library**, enter a name and click **Save current config** to store the current configuration as a named profile; **Export** writes it to a file and **Delete** removes it. At most 20 profiles are kept. **Apply** switches back to a profile through the same preview an import uses, so the default **Merge** keeps providers the profile omits — an exact restore means choosing **Replace** there.
3. **Import config → Choose file…** parses the file and shows an **Import preview** with the added / overwritten / removed counts; nothing is written before you confirm.
4. Imports default to **Merge** (keep what the file omits); **Replace** must be chosen explicitly and deletes providers the file does not contain. **Confirm import** first saves the configuration that stands right now under **Pre-import backup**, then writes the changes — restoring that copy goes through this same preview.

Export and import reuse the existing Settings channel, so the card works with both modern Remote Settings and the legacy `connection.api.settings`. When the result reports a namespace that takes effect on restart, restart DSH.

When importing a snapshot, only capability configuration is migrated by default. A provider's `baseURL`, `apiKeyEnv`, and `headers`, along with `opencodeSession.format.script`, are local deployment wiring and take effect only when you explicitly select **Also import endpoints and credentials (advanced)** in the preview.

### Legacy settings migration

DSH `0.1.7` renames `settings.yaml` and imports it exactly once, and plugin releases before this one failed to load on that version, so a thinking level or a model toggle you configured earlier can survive only inside `settings.yaml.imported`. On startup the plugin scans that document, a not-yet-renamed `settings.yaml`, and the live `llm-pi-ai` user layer. When it finds values this plugin owns that your own settings section does not already declare, it asks in a dialog above the settings page: **Migrate** writes them into this plugin's settings section, **Later** postpones the question for this page load, and **Don't ask again** records that exact offer, which returns only if the legacy data later changes. No legacy values are written before you choose **Migrate**, and the migration only fills in values you have not set, so it never overwrites one. The settings that stand right now are saved into the **Backup and profiles** rollback slot (`autoBackup`, marked `sourceProfile: migration`) in the same write batch as the migrated values. To look for legacy items on demand, use **Rescan legacy data** in the **Backup and profiles** card.

### Settings page layout

The page header contains the language selector. Below it, the Subagent default effort card controls the default for requests without an explicit effort. The Quick settings controls apply a preset across models. Provider sections can be expanded or collapsed; each model row exposes input capabilities, context length, and gateway compatibility controls in its settings area. `models[]` saves use one complete array set rather than an array-index path operation.

## How it works

- **Host:** Scans `llm-pi-ai` `models` and `modelOverrides` on startup and settings changes, adding defaults only where `reasoningEfforts` is missing. It writes through the user layer only, so it covers the models your own profile declares: a model a composition base or a schema default supplies has no entry in that layer to write into, so it is left alone and the Host logs how many were skipped. It also observes the model-level OpenCode session setting and injects the generated `x-opencode-session` (default `ses-derive`, configurable per `opencodeSession.format`) only into matching `llm/stream` requests, and rewrites `user-agent` for models opted into `opencodeSession.userAgent` (otherwise forced by the `llm-pi-ai` adapter's attribution header).
- **Client:** Registers the Settings page through the DSH Settings Remote (`ctx.remote.settings`) and, when the runtime exposes `modelDirectories`, registers the optional Composer `seat` with a low `shadow` priority and host-resolved effort slider. The model editor stores OpenCode session Header settings in the plugin namespace, separately from `llm-pi-ai.compat`. Chinese, English, Japanese, and Korean dictionaries are maintained separately in `src/locales/zh.json`, `src/locales/en.json`, `src/locales/ja.json`, and `src/locales/ko.json`, then generated into the client bundle before publishing.
- **Subagents:** Stores the default as `subagentEffort` in the plugin's own settings section on `0.1.7`+ (the `llm-pi-ai` user layer on `0.1.0-rc.7` through `0.1.6`). The Host reads the plugin's own section first and falls back to `llm-pi-ai`, where the value can only live on the releases before `0.1.7` — the entry-config `llm-pi-ai` section declares only `providers`, so its user layer never carries the key. The `agent/request` waterfall only fills requests that do not already specify an effort.
- **No configured default:** The plugin does not automatically choose `off`, `high`, or `max`; the request omits `reasoning` and the gateway decides its own default behavior.

## Limitations

- `llm-pi-ai` exposes seven standard levels: `off`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, and `max`.
- Non-`off` levels require a gateway value. An empty `off` value means that the parameter is omitted.
- The selected subagent level must be supported by the target model, or the gateway may return `UNSUPPORTED_REASONING_EFFORT`.
- `off` and an unset effort may both omit `reasoning`; whether this disables thinking depends on the gateway protocol.
- The Composer slider is available only when the Web runtime provides the optional `modelDirectories` service. The `seat` is not registered when that service is unavailable, and the plugin leaves Composer unchanged.
- Host changes require a DSH restart. Settings, locale, and Client bundle changes take effect after a Web page refresh.
- The profile library and the pre-import backup live in the plugin's own settings section and are not carried by an export. To move named profiles to another machine, export each profile and import it there.

## CI and release maintenance

- Pull requests and pushes to `main` run the quality matrix on Node `22.19.0` and `24.x`.
- The workflow uses `npm ci`; maintainers must commit `package-lock.json` when dependencies change.
- The ordinary CI workflow does not publish to npm. Publishing is triggered only by a `v<version>` tag through `publish.yml`.
- Before creating a release tag, update `package.json` version and `CHANGELOG.md` files, commit those changes, and create the matching `v<version>` tag. The tag must point to a commit in the `main` history.
- npm Trusted Publishing must be configured for repository `mikulo/dsh-thinking-effort` and workflow `publish.yml`. The workflow publishes provenance through GitHub OIDC and does not require `NPM_TOKEN`.
- Before publishing, the workflow builds and tests five official DSH capability representatives in this order: `dsh-v0.1.0-rc.7` (`0.1.0-rc.7`), `dsh-v0.1.1-rc.2` (`0.1.1-rc.2`), `dsh-v0.1.3-alpha.2` (`0.1.3-alpha.2`), `dsh-v0.1.6-alpha.1` (`0.1.6-alpha.1`), and `dsh-v0.1.7-alpha.1` (`0.1.7-alpha.1`), using the official `dsh plugin` command and real compatibility checks. The `0.1.6-alpha.1` (namespace model) and `0.1.7-alpha.1` (entry-config model) representatives both run the real-browser DOM probe.
- The workflow never changes the package version or any `CHANGELOG` file automatically; an existing npm version also blocks publishing.
